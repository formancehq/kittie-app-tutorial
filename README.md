# Let's Build a Money-Pooling App: Kittie

Apps for sending money to and pooling money with friends like [Venmo](https://venmo.com/), [Lydia](https://www.lydia-app.com), or [Tikkie](https://www.tikkie.me/) are a part of our daily lives now. Internally, as you can imagine, these apps require keeping track of pretty complex money flows—which makes building one a perfect demonstration of Formance's capabilities. So, let's use Formance to build a money-pooling app together!

Kittie is a full-featured demo app to show you how Formance can help you manage complex money flows in your fintech apps. We're going to build this app together step by step in this tutorial—and in step 1, we're going to get the app scaffolded and running with barebones functionality with the different services we're going to use, including Formance Ledger. In the next steps, we'll start building the necessary money flows, one feature at a time until we have a fully functional money-pooling app of our own!

## How this tutorial works

This git repo contains every step of the tutorial in a different branch. You're currently in branch `main`, which is the starting place. To start the tutorial, checkout out branch `step-1`. Then follow along with the instructions in the file `README.md`, run the tests, and make sure everything is just right. Then when you're ready, move on to the next step by checking out the next branch, `step-2`. The next branch will be set up to star you off right where the previous step left off. This is helpful in case you missed something small, or ran into trouble and couldn't fully complete the step yourself. You will need to throw your changes away between steps with a `git stash` or `git reset --hard`, to keep things clean (but of course you can always copy your work to a different folder if you are making customizations you want to keep).

Ready to jump in? Just do `git checkout step-1` and reload this README!
